# Goal

You will build a turn-based RPG game built on The Avengers universe. The game must run on any modern browser.

# Object

The player create a team of 3 Avengers. A team of 3 Supervillain is then randomly created. The AI then makes both team one against the other on a turn based flow. The winning team is the one with last man standing.

# The play

During a turn, one team attacks the other, and the other will attack during the next turn, and so on.

For each turn, the AI chooses for each team player, which opponent it has to attack, so the AI makes all decisions, no player input is required. Each player has 3 properties: Attack (atq), Defense (def), and Health Point (hp).

A player loses points of life after an opponent attack, and dies when there is no life point left.

The damage calculus is: opponent_hp = opponent_hp - (attacker_hp - opponent_defense). If attacker_hp < opponent_defense, then we consider the attack as with no effect.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
